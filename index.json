Mapper Relationships","content":"You can add relationships to a mapper inside its setRelated() method, calling one of the five available relationship-definition methods: oneToOne($field, $mapperClass) (aka \"has one\") manyToOne($field, $mapperClass) (aka \"belongs to\") oneToMany($field, $mapperClass) (aka \"has many\") manyToMany($field, $mapperClass, $throughField) (aka \"has many through\") manyToOneByReference($field, $referenceCol) (aka \"polymorphic association\") The $field will become a field name on the returned Record object. That field will be populated from the specified $mapperClass in Atlas. (In the case of manyToMany(), the association mappings will come from the specified $throughField.)Here is an example:&lt;?php namespace App\\DataSource\\Thread; use App\\DataSource\\Author\\AuthorMapper; use App\\DataSource\\Summary\\SummaryMapper; use App\\DataSource\\Reply\\ReplyMapper; use App\\DataSource\\Tagging\\TaggingMapper; use App\\DataSource\\Tag\\TagMapper; use Atlas\\Orm\\Mapper\\AbstractMapper; class ThreadMapper extends AbstractMapper { protected function setRelated() { $this-&gt;manyToOne('author', AuthorMapper::CLASS); $this-&gt;oneToOne('summary', SummaryMapper::CLASS); $this-&gt;oneToMany('replies', ReplyMapper::CLASS); $this-&gt;oneToMany('taggings', TaggingMapper::CLASS); $this-&gt;manyToMany('tags', TagMapper::CLASS, 'taggings'); } } "},{"id":"\/mapper\/2.x\/relationships.html#1-1-2-1","title":"1.1.2.1. Relationship Key Columns","content":"By default, in all relationships except many-to-one, the relationship will take the primary key column(s) in the native table, and map to those same column names in the foreign table.In the case of many-to-one, it is the reverse; that is, the relationship will take the primary key column(s) in the foreign table, and map to those same column names in the native table.If you want to use different columns, call the on() method on the relationship. For example, if the threads table uses author_id, but the authors table uses just id, you can do this:&lt;?php class ThreadMapper extends AbstractMapper { protected function setRelated() { $this-&gt;manyToOne('author', AuthorMapper::CLASS) -&gt;on([ \/\/ native (threads) column =&gt; foreign (authors) column 'author_id' =&gt; 'id', ]); \/\/ ... } } And on the oneToMany side of the relationship, you use the native author table id column with the foreign threads table author_id column.&lt;?php class AuthorMapper extends AbstractMapper { protected function setRelated() { $this-&gt;oneToMany('threads', ThreadMapper::CLASS) -&gt;on([ \/\/ native (author) column =&gt; foreign (threads) column 'id' =&gt; 'author_id', ]); \/\/ ... } } "},{"id":"\/mapper\/2.x\/relationships.html#1-1-2-2","title":"1.1.2.2. Composite Relationship Keys","content":"Likewise, if a table uses a composite key, you can re-map the relationship on multiple columns. If table foo has composite primary key columns of acol and bcol, and it maps to table bar on foo_acol and foo_bcol, you would do this:&lt;?php class FooMapper { protected function setRelated() { $this-&gt;oneToMany('bars', BarMapper::CLASS) -&gt;on([ \/\/ native (foo) column =&gt; foreign (bar) column 'acol' =&gt; 'foo_acol', 'bcol' =&gt; 'foo_bcol', ]); } } "},{"id":"\/mapper\/2.x\/relationships.html#1-1-2-3","title":"1.1.2.3. Case-Sensitivity","content":" Note: This applies only to string-based relationship keys. If you are using numeric relationship keys, this section does not apply. Atlas will match records related by string keys in a case-senstive manner. If your collations on the related string key columns are not case sensitive, Atlas might not match up related records properly in memory after fetching them from the database. This is because 'foo' and 'FOO' might be equivalent in the database collation, but they are not equivalent in PHP.In that kind of situation, you will want to tell the relationship to ignore the case of related string key columns when matching related records. You can do so with the ignoreCase() method on the relationship definition. &lt;?php class FooMapper { protected function setRelated() { $this-&gt;oneToMany('bars', BarMapper::CLASS) -&gt;ignoreCase(); } } With that in place, a native value of 'foo' match to a foreign value of 'FOO' when Atlas is stitching together related records."},{"id":"\/mapper\/2.x\/relationships.html#1-1-2-4","title":"1.1.2.4. Simple WHERE Conditions","content":"You may find it useful to define simple WHERE conditions on the foreign side of the relationship. For example, you can handle one side of a many-to-one relationship by reference (aka \"polymorphic association\") by selecting only related records of a particular type.In the following example, a comments table has a commentable_id column as the foreign key value, but is restricted to \"video\" values on a discriminator column named commentable_type.class IssueMapper extends AbstractMapper { protected function setRelated() { $this-&gt;oneToMany('comments', CommentMapper::CLASS) -&gt;on([ 'video_id' =&gt; 'commentable_id' ]) -&gt;where('commentable_type = ?', 'video'); } } (These conditions will be honored by MapperSelect::*joinWith() as well.)"},{"id":"\/mapper\/2.x\/relationships.html#1-1-2-5","title":"1.1.2.5. Relationships By Reference","content":"The many-to-one relationship by reference is somewhat different from the other relationship types. It is identical to a many-to-one relationship, except that the relationships vary by a reference column in the native table. This allows rows in the native table to \"belong to\" rows in more than one foreign table. The typical example is one of comments that can be created on many different kinds of content, such as static pages, blog posts, and video links.class CommentMapper extends AbstractMapper { protected function setRelated() { \/\/ The first argument is the field name on the native record; \/\/ the second argument is the reference column on the native table. $this-&gt;manyToOneByReference('commentable', 'commentable_type') \/\/ The first argument is the value of the commentable_type column; \/\/ the second is the related foreign mapper class; \/\/ the third is the native-to-foreign column mapping. -&gt;to('page', PageMapper::CLASS, ['commentable_id' =&gt; 'page_id']) -&gt;to('post', PostMapper::CLASS, ['commentable_id' =&gt; 'post_id']) -&gt;to('video', VideoMapper::CLASS, ['commentable_id' =&gt; 'video_id']); } } Note that there will be one query per type of reference in the native record set. That is, if a native record set (of an arbitrary number of records) refers to a total of three different relationships, then Atlas will issue three additional queries to fetch the related records.The phrase \"relationship by reference\" is used here instead of \"polymorphic association\" because the latter is an OOP term, not an SQL term. The former is more SQL-ish, and is lifted from Postgres; cf. https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/docs\/9.4\/static\/sql-createtable.html and search for \"REFERENCES\"."},{"id":"\/mapper\/2.x\/reading.html#1-1-3","title":"1.1.3.

The ThreadMapper might something like this:&lt;?php namespace App\\DataSource\\Thread; use App\\DataSource\\Author\\AuthorMapper; use App\\DataSource\\Summary\\SummaryMapper; use App\\DataSource\\Reply\\ReplyMapper; use App\\DataSource\\Tagging\\TaggingMapper; use App\\DataSource\\Tag\\TagMapper; use Atlas\\Orm\\Mapper\\AbstractMapper; class ThreadMapper extends AbstractMapper { protected function setRelated() { $this-&gt;manyToOne('author', AuthorMapper::CLASS); $this-&gt;oneToOne('summary', SummaryMapper::CLASS); $this-&gt;oneToMany('replies', ReplyMapper::CLASS); $this-&gt;oneToMany('taggings', TaggingMapper::CLASS); $this-&gt;manyToMany('tags', TagMapper::CLASS, 'taggings'); } } (We will leave the other mappers and their record classes for the imagination.)"},{"id":"\/mapper\/1.x\/domain.html#1-2-10-2","title":"1.2.10.2. Domain Model Interfaces","content":"At some point, we have decided we want to depend on domain Entities or Aggregates, rather than persistence Records, in our application.For example, the interface we want to use for a Thread Entity in domain might look like this:&lt;?php namespace App\\Domain\\Thread; interface ThreadInterface { public function getId(); public function getSubject(); public function getBody(); public function getDatePublished(); public function getAuthorId(); public function getAuthorName(); public function getTags(); public function getReplies(); } (This interface allows us to typehint the application against these domain- specific Entity methods, rather than using the persistence Record properties.)Further, we will presume a naive domain repository implementation that returns Thread Entities. It might look something like this:&lt;?php namespace App\\Domain\\Thread; use App\\DataSource\\Thread\\ThreadMapper; class ThreadRepository { protected $mapper; public function __construct(ThreadMapper $mapper) { $this-&gt;mapper = $mapper; } public function fetchThread($thread_id) { $record = $this-&gt;mapper-&gt;fetchRecord($thread_id, [ 'author', 'taggings', 'tags', 'replies', ]); return $this-&gt;newThread($record); } protected function newThread(ThreadRecord $record) { \/* ??? *\/ } } The problem now is the newThread() factory method. How do we convert a persistence layer ThreadRecord into a domain layer ThreadInterface implementation?There are three options, each with different tradeoffs: Implement the domain interface in the persistence layer. Compose the persistence record into the domain object. Map the persistence record fields to domain implementation fields. "},{"id":"\/mapper\/1.x\/domain.html#1-2-10-3","title":"1.2.10.3. Implement Domain In Persistence","content":"The easiest thing to do is to implement the domain ThreadInterface in the persistence ThreadRecord, like so:&lt;?php namespace App\\DataSource\\Thread; use Atlas\\Orm\\Mapper\\Record; use App\\Domain\\Thread\\ThreadInterface; class ThreadRecord extends Record implements ThreadInterface { public function getId() { return $this-&gt;thread_id; } public function getTitle() { return $this-&gt;title; } public function getBody() { return $this-&gt;body; } public function getDatePublished() { return $this-&gt;date_published; } public function getAuthorId() { return $this-&gt;author-&gt;author_id; } public function getAuthorName() { return $this-&gt;author-&gt;name; } public function getTags() { return $this-&gt;tags-&gt;getArrayCopy(); } public function getReplies() { return $this-&gt;replies-&gt;getArrayCopy(); } } With this, the ThreadRepository::newThread() factory method doesn't actually need to factory anything at all. It just returns the persistence record, since the record now has the domain interface.&lt;?php class ThreadRepository ... protected function newThread(ThreadRecord $record) { return $record; } Pros: Trivial to implement. Cons: Exposes the persistence layer Record methods and properties to the domain layer, where they can be easily abused. "},{"id":"\/mapper\/1.x\/domain.html#1-2-10-4","title":"1.2.10.4. Compose Persistence Into Domain","content":"Almost as easy, but with better separation, is to have a domain layer object that implements the domain interface, but encapsulates the persistence record as the data source. The domain object might look something like this:&lt;?php namespace App\\Domain\\Thread; use App\\DataSource\\Thread\\ThreadRecord; class Thread implements ThreadInterface { protected $record; public function __construct(ThreadRecord $record) { $this-&gt;record = $record; } public function getId() { return $this-&gt;record-&gt;thread_id; } public function getTitle() { return $this-&gt;record-&gt;title; } public function getBody() { return $this-&gt;record-&gt;body; } public function getDatePublished() { return $this-&gt;record-&gt;date_published; } public function getAuthorId() { return $this-&gt;record-&gt;author-&gt;author_id; } public function getAuthorName() { return $this-&gt;record-&gt;author-&gt;name; } public function getTags() { return $this-&gt;record-&gt;tags-&gt;getArrayCopy(); } public function getReplies() { return $this-&gt;record-&gt;replies-&gt;getArrayCopy(); } } Now the ThreadRepository::newThread() factory method has to do a little work, but not much. All it needs is to create the Thread domain object with the ThreadRecord as a constructor dependency.&lt;?php class ThreadRepository ... protected function newThread(ThreadRecord $record) { return new Thread($record); } Pros: Hides the persistence record behind the domain interface. Easy to implement. Cons: The domain object is now dependent on the persistence layer, which is not the direction of dependencies we'd prefer.

Map From Persistence To Domain","content":"Most difficult, but with the best separation, is to map the individual parts of the persistence record over to a \"plain old PHP object\" (POPO) in the domain, perhaps something like the following:&lt;?php namespace App\\Domain\\Thread; use App\\DataSource\\Thread\\ThreadRecord; class Thread implements ThreadInterface { protected $id; protected $title; protected $body; protected $datePublished; protected $authorId; protected $authorName; protected $tags; protected $replies; public function __construct( $id, $title, $body, $datePublished, $authorId, $authorName, array $tags, array $replies ) { $this-&gt;id = $id; $this-&gt;title = $title; $this-&gt;body = $body; $this-&gt;datePublished = $datePublished; $this-&gt;authorId = $authorId; $this-&gt;authorName = $authorName; $this-&gt;tags = $tags; $this-&gt;replies = $replies; } public function getId() { return $this-&gt;id; } public function getTitle() { return $this-&gt;title; } public function getBody() { return $this-&gt;body; } public function getDatePublished() { return $this-&gt;datePublished; } public function getAuthorId() { return $this-&gt;authorId; } public function getAuthorName() { return $this-&gt;authorName; } public function getTags() { return $this-&gt;tags; } public function getReplies() { return $this-&gt;replies; } } Now the ThreadRepository::newThread() factory method has a lot of work to do.

How much time you have available, and what kind of suffering you are willing to put up with.If you need something quick, fast, and in a hurry, implementing the domain interface in the persistence layer will do the trick. However, it will come back to bite in you just as quickly, as you begin to realize that you need different domain behaviors in different contexts, all built from the same backing persistence records.If you are willing to deal with the trouble that comes from depending on the persistence layer records inside your domain, and the possibility that other developers will expose the underlying record in subtle ways, then composing the record into the domain may be your best bet.The most formally-correct approach is to map the record fields over to domain object properties. This level of separation makes testing and modification of application logic much easier in the long run, but it takes a lot of time, attention, and discipline."},{"id":"\/skeleton\/getting-started.html#2-1","title":"2.1.
